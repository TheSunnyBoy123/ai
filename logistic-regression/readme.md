## Basic Idea
Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm. It is used to predict a binary outcome as a proability value between 0 and 1.

## When to use Logistic Regression
1. If label is binary - 0 or 1, True or False, Yes or No
2. If you need a probabilistic value of the label
3. If the data is linearly separable, i.e., the data can be separated using a straight line/plane
